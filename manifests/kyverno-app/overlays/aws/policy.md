We can check for multiple disallowed values using the `AnyIn` operator in Kyverno

**Option 1: Block specific dangerous ACLs (recommended)**

```yaml
- name: deny-dangerous-acls
  match:
    any:
    - resources:
        kinds: ["Bucket"]
  preconditions:
    all:
    - key: "{{request.object.spec.acl || ''}}"
      operator: NotEquals
      value: ""
  validate:
    message: "ACL values 'public-read', 'public-read-write', and 'authenticated-read' are disallowed for security reasons."
    deny:
      conditions:
        any:
        - key: "{{request.object.spec.acl}}"
          operator: AnyIn
          value: ["public-read", "public-read-write", "authenticated-read"]
```

**Option 2: Allow only specific safe ACLs (more restrictive)**

```yaml
- name: allow-only-safe-acls
  match:
    any:
    - resources:
        kinds: ["Bucket"]
  preconditions:
    all:
    - key: "{{request.object.spec.acl || ''}}"
      operator: NotEquals
      value: ""
  validate:
    message: "Only 'private', 'log-delivery-write', 'bucket-owner-read', and 'bucket-owner-full-control' ACLs are allowed."
    deny:
      conditions:
        any:
        - key: "{{request.object.spec.acl}}"
          operator: AnyNotIn
          value: ["private", "log-delivery-write", "bucket-owner-read", "bucket-owner-full-control"]
```

The key differences:
- `AnyIn` blocks if the value matches any in the list
- `AnyNotIn` blocks if the value is NOT in the allowed list
- Using `deny` section instead of `pattern` for clearer logic with multiple values

For production, I'd recommend Option 1 since it's more explicit about what we're blocking and why.
